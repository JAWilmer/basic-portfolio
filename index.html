            <p>An exciting, diverse, and winding road has led me to full stack web development, and to my home in Austin, TX.  I graduated from Gettysburg College (PA) with a Liberal Arts degree in Native American Studies, Art History, and Environmental Studies, which reflects my constant study of people and their relationship to place.  I spent some years as a National Park Ranger at several of our nation’s parks. I have also worked in the law field, as an event director, a wildland firefighter, and a math teacher.</p>
            
            <p>Although I have lived all over the world, I grew up primarily in Massachusetts.  I am an identical twin, dog mama to the cutest mini dachshund in Austin, avid reader, math geek, traveler, outdoor enthusiast, thrifter, coffee connoisseur, and photographer. I am also obsessive dancer of all sorts, including a dozen “couples” dances.  Some of my favorite and most accomplished dances are west coast swing, country two-step, and Argentine tango fusion.</p>
